------------------------------
Here u can browse some of my HTML5/THREE.js/jquery experiments.

I hope I'll find soon time to code more examples.

My next experiments will (hopefully) include some functionality
of Web Worker, ammo.js and brunch.



### If you wanna run the code...

...from your lokal system (not from a server), you need file access from files for the video manipulation.

* Chrome : Start Google Chrome with the following parameters: `chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files`

* Firefox: Type `about:config` into the URL field and set `security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy` to `false`.

-> FOR DEBUGGING, NOT FOR DAILY USE!
