soucecode of notiontaxi.org
===========================
Here u can browse some of my HTML5/THREE.js/jquery experemints.
I hope I'll find soon time to code more examples.

My next experiments will (hopefully) include some functionality
of Web Worker, ammo.js and brunch



If you wanna run the code...
----------------------------
...from your lokal system (not from a server), you need file access from files for the Video manipulation.

*Chrome
Start Google Chrome with the following parameters: 'chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files'

#Firefox
Type 'about:config' into the URL field and set 'security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy' on 'false'.

-> FOR DEBUGGING, NOT FOR DAILY USE!
